1. What is Tagaini-Jisho?
=========================

Tagaini Jisho is an open source[^OSS] Japanese dictionary application. It is
designed to help students of the Japanese language in their studies by 
providing:
    
* Complete Japanese vocabulary and Kanji Dictionaries, with more than
      130,000 entries and stroke order animation for more than 6,000 kanji;
* Powerful search mechanisms, including kanji radical search and other
      filters;
* Transparent connection of related entries, including transitive / 
      intransitive verb references and Homophones. Tagaini maximises the 
      logical connections between elements of the Japanese language in order
      to facilitate their memorisation;
* A study list which allows Tagaini to keep track of entries as you learn 
      them. It tracks your ability to remember each entry with flash cards.
* Notes and tags can be applied to entries, allowing you to group entries
      in a way that makes sense to you;
* Production of printed material, including a handy fold-able booklet to
      study anywhere. 

This version of the Tagaini Jisho documentation has been written using Tagaini
Jisho 0.2.4 as a base, and changes have been iterated into it for subsequent
versions. It is possible that some aspects of the program have been left out
or are ambiguous. If so, please feel free to contact the author or the Tagaini
mailing list. Contact details can be found in the contact section on either
the website or this document.

2. Getting Started
==================

Tagaini Jisho is a dictionary program. It allows you to search a dictionary for
terms and easily find related entries. This chapter covers the basic usage of
the application. 

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

2.1. The GUI
------------

![The GUI](images/tagaini_gui.png)

Tagaini Jisho's GUI, when opened for the first time, four main sections and
two toolbars. The first toolbar is holds miscellaneous functions, the second,
reasonably larger than the first, is the search toolbar. It controls which
search controls are displayed in the `search panel`, Directly beneath the
Toolbar. 

Below the search panel is `the results view`, which lists any results of the
search. The information is a short description to allow you to chose the
result you were after.

Tagaini will remember your searches, and you can go back and forward through
them with the left and right arrow at the top left of the results view, next
to where it displays the number of results. By default, the results view will
only list up to 50 entries. Beyond that, it will put them on a new page. Which
page you are viewing is controlled with the buttons to the top right of the
list. 

Below that is `the detailed view`, which displays any and all information on
a selected entry. The buttons above the view allow you to go back and forward
through selected entries. Next to them are the study flags, tag and
note buttons.

When you right click on an entry in the results window, it will open a context
menu. In the context menu are the same options that are along the top of the
detailed view, as well as a `Select All` option. Right clicking on a kanji in
the detailed view has the same effect, except that instead of `Select All` it
has `Open in detailed view...`, which opens an entry for the kanji in the
detailed view. Most kanji in the detailed view are references to an entry
about that kanji, so right clicking on them will act accordingly. You may also
right click on the magnifying icon, which is a reference to the stated chapter.

Tagaini's views can also be sized, to make the results or detailed view
larger, whilst making the other smaller. To do this, there is a small dotted
line above the detailed view's toolbar, directly below the results view
window. Clicking and dragging this up and down changes the size. If you move
it close enough to the top or bottom of the window, then it will snap up to
the edge, effectively removing the results or detailed view from the window.
This can be handy when practising sets, which will be covered latter. 

In 0.2.5, the lists view is added and will be on the left of the results view
the first time Tagaini 0.2.5 is opened. The Lists view can be detached from
the main window, used as a floating window or be reattached to the other side
of the Window, to appear on the right of the results view. In 0.2.5, the lists
view is added and will be on the left of the results view the first time
Tagaini 0.2.5 is opened. The Lists view can be detached from the main window,
used as a floating window or be reattached to the other side of the Window, to
appear on the right of the results view. There are also two toolbars, one made
up of the search tabs and the other miscellaneous tools. They can also be
detached and moved around separate to the main window, or repositioned,
either around the edges of the window. 

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

2.2. Searching Entries
----------------------

Along the top of the Tagaini window there is, by default, two toolbars. The
second of these toolbars is the search toolbar and it contains six tabs which
control which search options are currently visible. By default, the `Text
search` tab is selected, displaying the `Search Bar`, which is the simplest
way to search for entries. 

The search bar consists of a text field which doubles as a drop down list, and
a button. You can enter words, or terms, to search for
into the text field and then, when you either press the enter key or the search
button, it will search for the terms in the search bar. Whilst Tagaini is
searching for entries, the Tagaini Jisho logo, located above the results view
and below the search button, will spin. 

For instance, if you enter "`しけん`" into the search bar it will result in 試験
(test,) 私見 (personal opinion) and 私権 (private right.) If, however, you
enter "`しけん test`", it will search both terms and only result in 試験 (test)
as Tagaini will only display entries with all the search terms.

Every search term is separated by spaces, or double quotes; or `""`. To search
for a sentence, which includes spaces, you can enclose the sentence in
quotation marks, or `""`. For instance, if you search for `to run`, then
Tagaini will find and list every entry with both the word to and run in it. If
instead you search `"to run"`, then Tagaini will only find entries with the
words "to run" in them in that order.

As Tagaini matches terms to entries exactly, there is currently no romaji
search. So, searching for "`watashi`" will not result in 私：わたし. To find
an entry you must search either its kanji or hiragana reading.

On the search toolbar, to the right of the search tabs, there is a drop down
list  which, by default, says `All`. It is the dictionary selector. It has two
other options, `Vocabulary` and `Kanji`. Choosing one will tell Tagaini to
only search for vocabulary or kanji. Selecting all will tell Tagaini to search
through both the kanji and vocabulary dictionaries.

When searching through both dictionaries, it's quite common to come across two
similar-looking entries, such as two entries for 私 or 駅. These entries will
usually come up for single kanji words. This happens because it is displaying
an entry for the word, and an entry for the kanji. The two different entries
will have information about different things. This is discussed further in the 
next section.

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

2.3. Dictionary Entries
-----------------------

Entries are displayed in two different places. The results view and the
Detailed view.

The result view, by default, displays two lines for each entry in a list. The
first line contains the kanji and readings, the second line the definitions
and meaning of the entry.

In the detailed view each selected entry is displayed with all the information
in the entry. [Vocabulary][] entries are different to [Kanji][] entries.

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

### 2.3.1 Vocabulary 

![The GUI - 取る](images/tagaini_entries.png)

Vocabulary entries contain information about different vocabulary, whether it
is a word or a phrase. There are several common sections.

* **Main Reading** - Centred at the top of the view will be the wait the word
    or phrase is written, with furigana written in red above it. 
* **Variants** - Any variants are listed here, with their reading in brackets.
* **The definition block** - Here, different definitions are listed. First, it
    displays the definitions part of speech[^pos] in grey, and then lists
    different definitions, next to a flag representing the language of the
    definition.
* **JLPT level** - The entries JLPT level.
* **Kanji** - The kanji used in the main reading, and its meanings. This is 
    off by default. The kanji's JLPT level can also be appended to each
    reference.
* **Transitive／Intransitive buddy** - The entry corresponding with the current
    entries opposite transitive state.
* **Homophones** - Entries that are homophones of the current entry. A
    homophone is a word with the same or similar pronunciation. 

Any entry referenced in the detailed view will have a little magnifying glass
next to it, which is a link to the referenced entry. For instance, in the
entry 取る it references its intransitive buddy;

    Intransitive buddy: 取れる（とれる）: to come off, to be removed.

Clicking on the magnifying glass at the end of this line would display the
entry for 取れる in the detailed view. This does not affect your current set.

[^pos]: See http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/edict_doc.html for a list of
parts of speech markers.



******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

### 2.3.2 Kanji

Kanji entries contain information about a single kanji, what it means and how
it is used. By default, the kanji is centred in the detail view window and its meanings
are listed underneath it, also centred. From there there are several common
sections.

* **On**	    - The on reading, or 音読み（おんよみ）is the Chinese 
			reading of the kanji. It is written in katakana.
* **Kun**	    - The kun reading, or 訓読み（くんよみ）is the Japanese 
			reading of the character. It is written in hiragana.
* **Nanori**	    - The name readings of the kanji, or 名乗り（なのり）are
			readings that are only used in names.
* **Strokes**	    - The number of strokes it takes to write the kanji. 
* **Grade**	    - The grade it is taught to in Japanese schools.
* **Unicode**	    - The Unicode number, in hexadecimal.
* **Frequency**	    - How frequently the kanji appears in newspapers.
* **JLPT**	    - The kanji's JLPT level.  
* **SKIP**	    - The kanji's SKIP code.
* **Components**    - The radicals that make up the kanji.
* **Compounds**	    - Kanji that are made up with this kanji. 
* **Seen in**	    - A list of vocabulary that contains the kanji. Following 6 
			words have been displayed is a link to find all words
			using that the kanji.
Although kun readings for some entries, such as verbs and adjectives, can
include any extra kana needed to use the kanji, such as 取る's る (written
と.る,) searching the full reading, including extra kana past the full stop,
will not find the kanji entry, only the vocabulary entry. To find the kanji
entry you must search for just the kanji's reading, と in 取る's case, to find
it. 

In the detail view, you can click on any kanji, whilst looking at any entry,
and a pop up window will be displayed showing a short listing of the kanji, and
a stroke order animation. This works in both a kanji entry and a vocabulary
entry. 

![Kanji Tool tip](images/tagaini_kanji_popup02.png)

The small window will pop up under your mouse. It shows the kanji's meaning,
some of its readings, Frequency, Grade and JLPT, and components. Most notable,
however, is the animation of the kanji being written. It starts as an outline
which gets filled in, stroke by stroke. Each radical is written in a different
colour. 

Moving your mouse over a radical highlights that radical, so the colour
becomes lighter. Clicking on a radical, either on the animation or in the
components list, will open that radical by itself in the window. Underneath
the stroke order animation are animation control buttons, allowing you to
stop; pause; play, which it does by default; skip strokes and go back. 

Up the top are three buttons. The first, the magnifying glass, opens the
kanji's entry in the detailed view. The second provides an options menu, just
as when right clicking on an entry in the results view, and the last closes
the window.

2.4. Search Tabs
----------------

There are six search tabs located in the study toolbar, next to the dictionary
drop down list.
By default [Text Search][textex] is selected, and
the search bar is displayed. The other search tabs are labelled:
[Study][studyex]; [Tags][TagsnNotes]; [Notes][TagsnNotes]; 
[JLPT][jlptex]; [Vocabulary][vocabex]; [Kanji][kanjiex].
Changing the tab replaces the search bar with a set of different options
above the results view, that extends the search functionality to filter your
results according to set criteria.

If an an option in a tab is set then its the option will be included in the
tabs title along with a reset button, identical to the one to the left of the
search bar.

[textex]: #textex
[studyex]: #studyex
[TagsnNotes]: #tagsnNotesex
[jlptex]: #jlptex
[vocabex]: #vocabex
[kanjiex]: #kanjiex

[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

### 2.4.1. Text Search

The text search tab, as described above in section [2.2. Searching Entries]
is used for entering search terms. The text field also acts as a drop down
box, allowing previously searched terms to be found and reused easily. 

Another thing that can be put into the search field is a dictionary field
value. Doing this allows you to filter through your search results. This can
be done by adding `:field=value` as a search term, so `:grade=1` results in
every elementary grade 1 kanji being listed in the results view. The tabs
provide the same functionality for most of the fields, for instance kanji
grade can be found under the kanji tab. 

Tagaini also has support for wild cards[^wildcards]. The `*` character
represents an unknown string. Placing it at the end of a term searches for
everything beginning with that term, placing it at the beginning of a term
searches for everything ending with that term and placing it in the middle of
the a term searches for everything that starts and ends with that part of the
term. The `?` character represents a single unknown character but otherwise
works the same way. So `大*` represents everything that starts with 大 and
`*す` represents everything that ends with す. If the `?` character was used
instead then then `大?` would be any two character entry where the first was
大 and `?す` would be any two character entry that ends with す. Note that the
asterisk and question marked gotten from IM's, `＊` and `？`, are different
from the ASCII characters, `*` and `?`, which work as wild cards. 

The button to the left of the search bar, which looks like a black box with a
white x in it, clears the search bar, resetting it to default, ready to use
again.

[^wildcards]: Wild cards are characters used to represent unknown characters in search terms.

[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

### 2.4.2. The Study Tab
	
![The Study Extender](images/tagaini_ex_studied.png)

The study tab, the second tab, filters through searches according
to whether or not the entry is on the study list. The study status defaults to
`None`, so it does not filter results. Changing this to `Studied` will cause
only entries in the study list to be listed in the results view. `Not studied`
causes only results not in the study list to be shown[^studynum].

To add entries to the study list, either right click on them in the results
view, or use the detailed view toolbar and click the blue flag, `Add to study
list`, which adds the entry to the list with a score of 0. The green flag,
`Already known`, will add the entry with a score of 100. 

Each entry is given a colour between red and green according to their score, and
it is displayed as the entries background in the results view. As you 
practise[^practicefoot], the score on each entry in your study list will
change. You will then be able to filter entries that you know you know from
your searches. When the study status is set to `studied` Tagaini will only
search through entries that have a score within the range of `Min` and `Max`,
the values from the score section.

The study date section filters entries according to the date the entry was
added to the study list. Clicking any of the not set buttons, in this section
or the others, brings up a calendar to select a date or allows you to set a 
number of days／weeks／months／years prior to today's date. If an entry has
been added after the `since` date and before the `until` date then it will be
listed in the results view in any searches.

The last trained section allows you to set a time range for finding entries
according to when you last practised it, and the last mistaken section allows 
you to set a time range for when you last marked an entry as incorrect.

[^practicefoot]: See Chapter 5 Section 2; [Study List][] for more information on
practising with your study list, as well as manipulating it. 

[^studynum]: Just setting the status to `not studied` without any other search 
criteria will cause every entry not in the study list to be listed. This is
likely to be a large number of entries.



<a name="tagsnNotesex" />

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

### 2.4.3. The Tags and Notes Tab

Tags and Notes are similar in that they both label entries. They can be added
to entries with either the right click menu in the results view or the
detailed views toolbar.


![The Tags Extender](images/tagaini_ex_tags.png)

Tags are short strings used to identify an entry. Each tag is a single
word given to an entry that can be used as a filter. For instance, if you are
studying from a text book, you could add the text books name to each vocab
entry you need to learn, along with its chapter number as another entry. You
can then type tags into the filter and search through just those
entries, or view all of them. There is also a drop down list to the right
of the text field which contains a complete list of tags, so you can just select
the ones you want. 

If an entry has a tag, a small tag icon will be displayed on the right side of
the entry in the results view, next to the scroll bar and at the bottom of
the entry in the detailed view.

To add a tag, you can use the `Add tags...` button, which looks like a tag
with a green bit at the top. White space, or spaces, separates each tag, so
writing "genki ch04" adds two tags; "genki" and "ch04".

Any tags you add with the `Add tags...` in the current
session[^tagainisession] can be found again in the `Recently added tags...`
sub menu of the context menu[^contextmenu], which makes adding tags to a set
of entries easier. The `Set tags...` button brings up a list of all the
current tags attached to an entry so that they can be edited. Additional tags
can be entered here. Despite the `Add tags...` button not bringing up tags
that have already been set on an entry, adding new ones does not overwrite the
existing ones, it just appends them to the list.

[^tagainisession]: Each session is each time you run the program. If you run
Tagaini, use it for five minutes and close it, then that is one session.
If you run it again five minutes later then you are running a different
session.

[^contextmenu]: Right click menu.


![The Notes Extender](images/tagaini_ex_notes.png)

Notes are different to tags in that a note can be a sentence or two. You could
use notes to describe the relationship between a word or another or any other
noteworthy information about the entry. For instance, if a word, such as
降る、appears in a textbook you are studying in a phrase, such as
雨が降る/雨が降ります、in a chapter before the entry itself, you may wish note
that in the entry. In the example one may write "Appears in chapter 4 of
textbook_name as 雨が降る".

When you search with the `notes` filter, the search will match any entries with
whatever text you write in the text field, exactly. If, using the above
example, you have two different entries on verbs that have been used in
phrases and have noted this, if you search for "Appears in" it will find both
of these entries, however if they are in separate chapters and you extend that
string to "Appears in chapter 5", then it will only find the one that has that
exactly. 

To add a note, use the `Edit notes...` button, which looks like a yellow
stick-it note pad and a pen. It will bring up a window with
any existing notes. You can edit existing notes by selecting them and editing
them, add new notes with the `New note` button, and delete notes.

### 2.4.4. The JLPT Tab

JLPT stands for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. It is a test
administered by the `Japan Foundation` and `Japan Educational Exchanges and
Services` for the purposes of evaluating and certifying the Japanese language
proficiency of non-native speakers.[^jlptfoot]

Up until 2010 there have been four levels, with level 4 being the lowest and 1
being the highest. Currently JMDict and kanjidict, the Japanese Vocabulary and
Kanji dictionaries used by Tagaini Jisho, have vocabulary and kanji likely to
be included in the tests marked as such. This gives us the ability to filter
our searches for entries known to be used in the tests. The JLPT tab
provides that functionality.

[^jlptfoot]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Language_Proficiency_Test  
http://www.jlpt.jp/e/

![The JLPT Extender](images/tagaini_ex_jlpt.png)

There are four check boxes, each one matching a level. With level 4 selected,
every level 4 entry will be listed and any searches will only find level 4
entries. Selecting multiple levels will include multiple levels. 


<a name="vocabex" />

[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")

### 2.4.5. The Vocabulary Tab

![Vocabulary Extender - Dialect: Kansai-ben](images/tagaini_ex_vocab_ksb.png)

`The vocabulary tab` has vocabulary specific filter options. It can not be
used in conjunction with the kanji tab.

The first two text fields relate to the kanji found in vocab entries. The `With
kanji` field will find any vocab entry that contains a kanji. If you enter two
kanji then the entry must contain both kanji. Next to it is a checkbox labelled
`Using studied kanji only`. It forces the search to use only kanji from the
study list. 

Kanji are made up of different kanji, or radicals, so the `With components`
field searches for kanji that include a component. For instance, 私 is made up
of 禾 (which is composed of 丿 and 木) and 厶, so searching for 丿, 木 and 厶
in the `With components` field will find any entry with kanji with those
radicals, including any entry that contains the kanji 私.

Below that are four sub menus, labelled `Part of speech`, `Dialect`,
`Field` and `Misc`. Each of these finds entries that belong to any of the
groups you select in the menus. The `Part of speech` menu allows you to search
for different parts of speech, such as nouns or verbs; `Dialect` finds words
that belong to different places in Japan; `Field` finds terms and jargon from
different fields and schools of knowledge, such as computer or religious terms
and `Misc` contains anything that doesn't belong in the other categories, such
as children's language, obsolete terms and slang. 

<a name="kanjiex" />

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

### 2.4.6. The Kanji Tab

![Kanji Extender - Component: 又](images/tagaini_ex_kanji.png)

The kanji tab contains filtration options specific to kanji entries and
as such cannot be used in conjunction with the vocabulary tab.

The first section on the tab, `Stroke count`, finds every kanji that has 
`n` strokes in it, `n` being a number between 1 and 34.

The next section, `Components`, acts in the same way as its counterpart in
the vocabulary tab. It searches for a kanji based on the radicals that
create it. The difference is in the entries being searched, instead of
searching vocabulary entries, which could have multiple kanji, The kanji
tab affects searches through the kanji dictionary. As such, only one
instance of a kanji will be returned.

The `Unicode` section, in the middle of the tab, finds the character with
the Unicode value `0xH` where `H` is a hexadecimal[^hex] value representing the 
number. No two characters have the same value. For instance, the character 取
has a Unicode value of 0x53d6. Putting that in the Unicode field will result
in the entry for 取 being listed.

The next section is for finding kanji by `SKIP code`. A skip code is a way of
categorising kanji according to its type. SKIP codes are comprised of three
numbers and are annotated X-Y-Z. Each slider in the `SKIP code` section relates
to one of these numbers.[^SKIPfoot]

The fifth section, or second from the right, is labelled `Four corner`. It
provides four drop down boxes corresponding to each corner of a Chinese
character and a fifth box for miscellaneous strokes. Four corner method is a
Chinese input method to used to find kanji.[^FCfoot] 

The last section, `School grade`, represents which school level the kanji is
taught in. 

[^SKIPfoot]: http://www.basic-japanese.com/Hilfsdateien/skipCode.html  

[^FCfoot]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corner_Method

[^hex]: Hexadecimal, or hex, is a counting system like decimal. Instead of
having 10 values (0-9), such as decimal or base ten, it has 16 values and can be
called base 16. As there are no more single numeric characters after 9, hex
continues on from the beginning of the alphabet, so A is equivalent to decimal
10. This means hex has a range of 0-F.

3. Preferences
==============

The preferences window provides the ability to edit Tagaini's look, feel and
how it handles several things. It can be opened via `Program -> Preferences`.

It is a window with a menu down the left, containing the different pages.
Options for each page are located on the right of the menu.

3.1. General
------------

![General Preferences](images/tagaini_pref_gen.png)

The general preferences page, the one that the preferences window opens on,
contains general settings that affect the entire program.

The `application default font` is the font that the application uses to display
any information in the interface itself, such as the text "`Application default
font`" and "`You need to restart Tagaini Jisho for this change to take effect.`"
It is the font that all the menus are in.

The `dates` section specifies which day of the week the week starts on.

The `updates` section specifies how often Tagaini checks for updates, if at
all.

The `entries cache` section specifies how many entries Tagaini keeps in memory.
The default is equivalent to 1000.

3.2. Results View
-----------------

![Results View Preferences](images/tagaini_pref_results.png)

The results view page specifies how entries are displayed in the results view.

The results display section specifies the format of each entry. Entries can
be displayed on one line, or over two with the definition underneath the
reading. The number of entries per page can be changed, as well as how results
are sorted; By score, then relevance or just by relevance. `Smooth scrolling`
changes whether or not there is a scrolling animation played, or if it just
snaps down to the next entry.

The fonts section allows different fonts to be selected for the different parts
of the display. The `Main writing` section is the first kanji or kana which
shows how it is usually written. `Readings and alternative writings` specifies
how readings are displayed and `definitions` refers to the Romaji text that
the meaning of the entry is displayed in. The default font is a Qt system
default. 

The `preview` section contains some dummy entries and is displayed according
to the results view page and is updated in real time, so changes can be seen as
they are made.

[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

3.3. Detailed View
------------------

![Detailed View Preferences](images/tagaini_pref_detail.png)

The detailed view preferences page describes how the detailed view should be
displayed. 

The `fonts` section specifies each font used in the detailed view. There are
five in all.

* `Default text` -  The font to use with any non-Japanese characters. 
* `Kana header` -   The red furigana reading, centred above the large kanji 
		    text.
* `Kanji header` -  The large centred kanji text, signifying the main reading.
* `Kanji` -	    Any kanji in the display, for alternative writings and 
		    referenced entries.
* `Kana` -	    Any kana in the display, for alternative readings and 
		    referenced entries.

The `preview` view has a dummy detailed view that updates in real time. `Smooth
scrolling` can be turned on and off in the `general` section. `Show JLPT level
in short descriptions` toggles the JLPT display on and off in short
descriptions, used for links to other entries, such as the opposite transitive
state of a verb. 


******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

3.4. Vocabulary Entries
-----------------------

![Vocabulary Display](images/tagaini_pref_vocab_dis.png)

The `vocabulary entries` page has three tabs. The first, `display`, has two
sections. `Basic information` and `additional information.`

The `basic information` section specifies whether or not the entries `JLPT
level` is displayed. The `kanji used in main reading` section check box toggles
on the kanji section and the `JLPT level of kanji` section toggles displaying
the JLPT level next to referenced kanji.

The `additional information` contains extra information about
related entries. `Search for transitive／intransitive verb buddy` controls
whether or a references is included to an entry with an opposite transitive
state. The number before `Homophones` is the maximum number of homophones to
reference. `Studied only` causes only homophones in the study list to be
displayed.

![Vocabulary Printing](images/tagaini_pref_vocab_printing.png)

The `printing` tab defines how entries look when printed[^printfoot]. The
`general` section has the header's (The main reading) `font size` and the
`maximum number of definitions`.

The `kanji` section specifies whether or not to show each kanji's meaning
separately underneath the header, and if only to show studied kanji.

The `preview` shows a single entry, specifically 大変. It updates as changes
are made.

[^printfoot]: See Chapter 5 section 3; [Results][].

![Vocabulary Definition Filtering](images/tagaini_pref_vocab_filter.png)

The `definition filtering` allows the filtration of Terms. By default,
obsolete terms and archaisms are filtered out. This stops entries marked as
such from being found by searches. To filter out additional categories,
select them in the `displayed` section and press the arrow button that points
to the `filtered` section. 

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

3.5. Kanji Entries
------------------

![Kanji Display](images/tagaini_pref_kanji_disp.png)

The `display` tab, the first of four tabs on the kanji entries page, describes
which information should be displayed in the detailed view.

In `basic information`, there are a series of checkboxes relating to
different pieces of information in the entry. Each one toggles display of that
element on and off.

* **Readings**	    - On and Kun readings.
* **Nanori**	    - Nanori reading.
* **# of strokes**  - Number of strokes in the kanji.

* **Frequency**	    - The frequency rating of the kanji.
* **Variations**    - Any variations in the strokes of the kanji.
* **Original**	    - The way the kanji was originally written.

The `additional information` section controls how many `compounds`, words made
of two or more kanji,  are shown, as well as how many `words using the kanji`.

![Kanji Printing](images/tagaini_pref_kanji_print.png)

The `printing` tab controls how kanji entries look when printed.

The `kanji information` section controls what is displayed, whilst `Kanji
drawing style` controls the font of the kanji. `Preview` is an updating
preview, using the entry for 間.

The values in `kanji information` are:

* **Meaning**			- The kanji's meaning
* **Onyomi**			- The `on` reading, or 音読み。
* **Kunyomi**			- The `kun` reading, or 訓読み
* **Components**		- The kanji's radicals.
* **Only studied components**	- Only show kanji in the study list.
* **`n` words**			- Shows `n` words using the kanji.
* **Only studied words**	- Filter out words not in the study list.

In the `kanji drawing style` section the kanji's size is set, along with if it
is written in a handwritten font, or in the default font.

![Kanji ToolTips](images/tagaini_pref_kanji_tooltip.png)

The kanji tool tip, which is the tooltip that shows up when the mouse is
hovering over a kanji in the detailed view, is a yellow box which displays
the kanji; its first reading and its meanings. The options on this page toggle
on／off additional information. 

* **Kanji tool tip enabled** - Enables the tool tip.
* **Score**		    - Shows the score colour for entries in the study

4. Advanced Features
====================

Tagaini Jisho is more than just a dictionary. It provides facilities for
training and memorisation of vocabulary and kanji. It will remember sets of
kanji, has flash card facilities and will print sets for latter viewing. 

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

4.1. Lists
---------

A new feature in Tagaini Jisho 0.2.5, `Lists` should be visable as soon as you
start the Tagaini. A panel, by default, down the left of the window that is
marked `Lists`. This panel can be removed, by clicking the small `X` button
at the top right of the panel. It can also be detached from the main window,
or moved to the right of the results view. If the Lists panel is not visible
in 0.2.5 then it can be turned back on via the checkbox in the `Search` menu.

![Tagaini Jisho 0.2.5 - Lists](images/tagaini_lists.png)

The lists panel has two buttons. The first, `Create a new list`, creates a
new list. The second, `Delete currently selected list`, recursively deletes all
this list and its contents. 

Each list is a tree branch in the list view panel. When a new list is
created, it does not have a parent and is named `New list`. Double clicking on
the branch will allow renaming. As every list is a branch, clicking and
dragging them onto another list will set it to be a child of that list,
allowing this lists to be embedded.

When a list has children, a little `+` or `-` symbol will show up to its left.
When the symbol is a `+`, the children are hidden and clicking on the symbol
will expand the tree, so that all the children are visible. When the symbol
is a `-` the contents of the list are visible. They can be hidden by clicking
on the `-` symbol. 

Lists are useful for sorting and organising entries that may be frequently
viewed. To add an entry to a list, Drag and drop it onto one of the lists from
the results view. doing this creates a child entry that links to that entry.
Clicking on it in the lists view then opens the entry in the detailed view. 

To delete a list and its contents, select it and click the button that looks
like a red `x`. This will display a warning that points out that the operation
will delete the list and all of its children. 

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

4.2. Sets
---------

A `set` is the list created by a search and displayed in the results view.
Tagaini can remember specific sets. If you have made a search that you think
you will want to make again, such as all transitive verbs used in computer
terminology at the JLPT 2 level, you can create a new set, to make it easier
to find again.

![Sets Menu](images/tagaini_sets_menu.png)

The `sets` menu contains functions for creating and organising sets. Two
options allow the creation and placement of sets directly from the menu, `New
set from current search...` and `New sets folder...`, and the last, `organise
sets...` Brings up another window for organising sets. 

As you create new sets with the menu option, it displays them at the bottom
of the menu. Clicking on them there will open that set in the results
window.

When you create a new menu, it too will appear in the sets menu, as a sub
menu. It will then have two options, `Create new set here...` and `Create new
folder here...`. They will act as the two options in the main sets menu,
except they will place created sets and folders as sub items of that folder.
These two options always appear at the bottom of the menu.

![Organise Sets](images/tagaini_sets_organise.png)

To organise or reorganise sets, The `organise sets` window, found in the sets
menu, allows you to drag and drop sets into different folders, as well as
delete them. Double clicking on a set or folder will allow you to rename it.
Right clicking on the set will allow you to delete it and dragging them around
will move them to the new position. This allows you to sort them amongst
themselves as well as into new folders.

4.3. Results
------------

Tagaini is a computer application, and some of the best times to study are
those long hours spent commuting on trains, in waiting rooms or, for students,
between classes. Unless you are drag a laptop around with you everywhere, You
wont have access to Tagaini or its study features, so instead you can print
out sets.

![Results Menu](images/tagaini_results.png)

Tagaini can print two different types of paper media. Lists of vocabulary or
kanji, and Pocketmod books, vocabulary and kanji lists formatted in such a way
that the paper can be folded into a small, pocket sized, book. The `print`
option prints normally formatted lists, whilst the `print booklet(s)` option
prints out booklets. Each option also has a preview option. 

What is printed is limited by what is in the results window. If a search has
turned up 60 entries, and Tagaini is set to only show 50 of those entries on a
page, then Tagaini will only print those 50 entries. 

In the `Export displayed entries...` menu is an option labelled `as a tab
separated file...`. This option exports the first page in the results view as
a plain text file, with entries formatted:

    漢字	    かな	    Romaji

or

    Expression	    Reading	    Meaning

This was originally written for exporting to anki[^ankifoot], a flash card
program, but will work with any other application that can import entries in
this format.

******

4.4. Study List
---------------

The study list is an invisible list of vocabulary and kanji, used to mark
entries for study. Each entry has a score, based on how well you know the
entry. This score is represented by a background colour for the entry when
listed in the results view. Red represents not knowing it, or having a 0
score, and green represents knowing it, or having a score of 100. The colour
gradiates from red to yellow to green as the score gets higher. Entries with
low scores are shown first.

The study list is manipulated with the flag buttons in the detailed view tool
bar and the context menu given when right clicking on entry references, either
in the results view or the display view. 

When adding entries to the study list, there are two relevant flags. The blue
flag, `Add to study list` and the green flag, `already known`. The blue flag
adds the entry with a score of 0, whilst the green flag adds the entry with a
score of 100.

After an entry has been added, the blue flag changes colour and becomes a
black flag, which removes the entry from the study list. Another flag, which
was previously greyed out, also becomes available. It is a red flag and marked
`Reset score`. It sets the entries score to 0.

An entries score goes up and down as you practise it.

4.5. Practice
-------------

The practice menu has four different options. Settings; vocab flash cards;
kanji flash cards and reading practice. The flash card options are sub menus,
each with `by set` and `entire study list` options for reading to translation 
and translation to reading.

![Trainer Settings](images/tagaini_train_settings.png)

The settings window, brought up by clicking the `Whole study list train
settings...` buttons, Which allows you to set what to include and exclude in
study exercises. The `date of last training` section specifies what to include
based on the last time it was studied. It defaults to before yesterday, so it
wont include anything that you have already studied in the last twenty four
hours. The score section specifies what to include based on score. If you only
want to study things you are less familiar with you can change it to `between
0 and 50` and it would only show you red to yellow entries. The `sort bias`
specifies if entries with a low score should be more likely to appear before
entries with higher scores.

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

###4.5.1. Vocabulary Flashcards

There are four options in total in the vocabulary flashcards submenu: `From
Japanese, whole study set`; `From Japanese, current set`; `From translation,
whole study set` and `from translation, current set`. Each option will display
different contents in the same window. It will either show the translation or
reading first, from an entry that has been pulled either from the study list
or the current set.

![Vocab Training](images/tagaini_train_vocab.png)

The `training` window has four buttons up the top; `Answer` and `skip`, as
well as two initially greyed out options, `correct` and `wrong`. Underneath
this is a detailed display window. It will only display part
of an entry initially. Either the Japanese if you have selected `from
Japanese`, or the definition. 

If you have selected a `from Japanese` option, then there is an extra option
along the detailed view toolbar, `Show furigana`, a checkbox which toggles
whether or not the furigana for the entry is displayed.

When you have decided whether or not you know the answer, pressing the answer
button will display the rest of the entry, just as it would in the detailed
display. You can then tell Tagaini if you got it correct or incorrect, which
modifies the entries score, or skip the entry, which doesn't change it at all.

Whilst the whole entry is displayed, you can use the detailed view as normal,
however the toolbar is greyed out before hitting the answer button. When you
tell Tagaini how well you remembered the entry, it goes to a new entry at
random, and you can repeat the process until you have run out of entries in
the set. Down the bottom of the view some statistics are displayed. 

    Correct: 5, Wrong: 1, Total: 6

The numbers correspond to how well you are doing in that particular set. Every
time you a new training system, even with the same set, the numbers are all set
back to 0. 

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

### 4.5.2. Kanji Flashcards

The kanji flashcards menu, like the vocabulary flash cards menu, has four
options: `From kanji, whole study list`; `From kanji, current set`; `From
meaning, whole study list` and `from meaning, current set. Choosing a from
kanji option displays the kanji by itself, allowing you to guess its meaning
and reading. Choosing a "by meaning" option, displays the kanji's meaning and
allows you to guess the kanji. 

![Kanji Training](images/tagaini_train_kanji.png)

Studying kanji is similar to studying vocabulary. The window is the same, the
buttons are the same. After you have asked for the answer you can use the
display view, now showing the whole entry, as normal. You can mark an entry as
correct or incorrect. You can chose to just skip it. The totals are down the
bottom of the view. You cannot, however, ask for furigana as that would
defeat the point of trying to memorise the kanji. 

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

### 4.5.3. Reading Practice

The last option in the practice menu is `reading practice, whole study set`.
It brings up the `reading practice` window, which is a bit different to the
flash card window. 

![Reading Practise](images/tagaini_train_reading.png)

The window shows you a vocab entries written form, and asks you to type the
correct reading for the entry. Underneath the text field, it has a detailed
display which shows only the entries definitions. You must type the entry in
kana (かな) to get entries correct, it will not accept romaji answers, though
it does not mind if the answer is in hiragana ひらがな or katakana かたがな. 

![Reading Practise Error](images/tagaini_train_reading_batsu.png)

When you get the answer correct it displays the word `correct` in green writing
between the detailed display and the text field and moves immediately on to the
next entry. When you get the entry incorrect, however, it displays `Error!` in
read writing between the text field and the detailed view and changes the text
field into a long next button. The detailed view shows the entire entry so you
can see where you went wrong. When you press the next button it will show the
next entry.

4.5. Importing and exporting data 
---------------------------------

User settings can be exported and imported from Tagaini. This allows you to
move study lists, tags, notes and other things Tagaini remembers between
versions. The `export user data` item in the `program` menu saves out a small
data base with these settings, so that another instance of Tagaini may load
it, whether it is another user on the same computer or on a different computer
altogether.

******
[Table of Contents] - [Top](#top "Top")
******

4.6. Kanji Input Panel
----------------------

![Kanji IM](images/tagaini_kanji_im.png)

The kanji input panel, located in the miscellaneous toolbar with the prev/next
search results buttons, can be used to find kanji by radical. It can only be
opened when part of the UI that can take keyboard input, such as the search
bar, has the focus. 

It has three sections, the first of which is a text field that will only take
Japanese characters, from an IM. It will then use the characters in this
field to search for kanji by radical. Instead of memorising the readings of
radicals and entering them manually, the third view on the panel contains a
list of radicals, ordered by number of strokes. Clicking on one of these
radicals will send it to the search field, starting the search. 

The middle field will then show every kanji with the radicals in the search
field. 

![Kanji IM - 地](images/tagaini_kanji_im02.png)

So to find 地 one could start by entering "`土`" into the text field, or by
finding it listed under 3 strokes. The field beneath would then start to list
kanji with that radical. With this example, the desired character, 地, can be
seen immediately. Clicking on the kanji will place it in the search field, or
which ever text field had the focus when the kanji input panel was brought up.
To close the panel, just clicking outside it will close it and return Tagaini
to its normal functions.

5. Troubleshooting
==================

Unable to read Japanese
-----------------------

If you are unable to read Japanese text, you probably don't have any Japanese
font's installed. You will likely have to install the Japanese language pack
in windows and Mac OS X. To get Japanese support in Linux please see your
distributions documentation, if the information and links provided in Tagaini's
Install Guide were insufficient. 

Unable to type Japanese text
----------------------------

Inputting Japanese text is not handled by Tagaini, instead by what is called an
Input Manager. You will need to install and use one of these to input Japanese
text. For instructions on installing an IM, please see Tagaini's install
guide.

Tagaini won't compile from GIT
------------------------------

Tagaini depends sqlite, but will not link with your systems sqlite libraries
because Tagaini requires a slightly customised version of sqlite. This is not
kept in Tagaini's git repo. Instead, you first have to get it and the
dictionaries. This is the first command you need to run, from the install
guides compiling from git section.

     tagaini-jisho $ ./prepare-source.sh

continuing from the `cmake .` command after running this command should
help.

Database Issues when Compiling from Source
------------------------------------------

Currently, when compiling from source Tagaini does not install the databases
anywhere. This means that Tagaini can only be run from the folder that
contains the databases. To be able to run Tagaini from wherever, the databases
have to be copied into the tagaini database path manually. 

If updating an existing version of Tagaini by compiling the source code, 
installing it may cause the existing databases to fail. For example, a table
in the kanji database changed between 0.2.397 and 0.2.4 which causes kanji
entries not to have meanings if run without updating the databases. To fix
this, rebuild the databases and copy it to the path.

The databases can be copied into the following places on a Linux system:

    /usr/local/share/tagainijisho
    /usr/share/tagainijisho

Other Bugs
----------

If you have an issue that is not listed above, you may wish to check Tagaini's
bug tracker on [launchpad][btfoot], or the [mailing lists][mailfoot]. Chances are that someone else
has already reported the problem and an work around has been posted. If no one
else has reported the bug, then please feel free to do so.
