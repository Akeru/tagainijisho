<p>Here is a short manual on how to use Tagaini Jisho. Instructions in this manual apply to version 0.2.2.<br>
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Tagaini Jisho is a designed to help the student of Japanese finding and
remembering words and kanjis of interest. It does so by providing the
following features:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A complete Japanese vocabulary and kanji dictionary, featuring
more than 130.000 words entries and stroke order animations for more
than 6.000 kanjis ;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Very powerful search mechanisms, including kanji search by components, search by JLPT level, ...</li>
  <li>Transparent
connection of related entries, i.e. transitive
counterparts of intransitive verbs, words using the same kanji, ...
Tagaini maximizes the logical connections between elements of the
Japanese language in order to facilitate their memorization ;<br>
  </li>
  <li>A study list that keeps track of all the entries you want to
memorize and your ability to remember them by a score. It is also
possible to filter search results by score ;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Notes and tags can be applied to entries and searched after ;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Production of printed material, including a handy foldable booklet to study anywhere!<br>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Main Window Overview</h2>

<p>The main window follows a simple design, with a search bar, a
results view and a detailed view (from top to bottom), that is able to
display both dictionary entries and kanjis.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" mce_style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 622px; height: 682px;" alt="" src="sites/tagaini.net/files/images/mainwindow.png" mce_src="/sites/tagaini.net/files/images/mainwindow.png"></p>

<h2>The Search Bar</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;" mce_style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 607px; height: 46px;" alt="" src="sites/tagaini.net/files/images/searchbar.png" mce_src="/sites/tagaini.net/files/images/searchbar.png"></p>

<p>The search bar is where you can enter terms (in English or Japanese) to look for. Just enter the text to look up and click the <span style="font-style: italic;">Search</span> button (or press <span style="font-style: italic;">Enter</span>)
to perform a search. When a search is being performed, the icon at the
right of the window animates. Clicking it allows you to cancel the
ongoing
search in case it takes too much time.<br>
</p>
<p>Looking up words and kanjis is pretty easy, as Tagaini is designed
to correctly guess what you are looking for from your input. Just type
in the words that you are looking for, in English or Japanese (kanas or
kanjis). Results that match all the words are then displayed. You can
mix words in Japanese and English - in that case, you will get results
where both the Japanese word and English definition match. For
instance, if you enter&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;" mce_style="font-weight: bold;">&#12375;&#12369;&#12435;</span>, you will get definitions for both &#35430;&#39443; (test) and &#31169;&#35211; (personal opinion). However, if you enter&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;" mce_style="font-weight: bold;">&#12375;&#12369;&#12435; test</span>, only the first definition will show up.</p>

<p>Entering a single character kanji will not only return words that
are written using this kanji alone, but also detailed information for
that kanji. For instance, if you search for&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;" mce_style="font-weight: bold;">&#39365;</span>,
you will have two different results: one for the word &#39365; (&#12360;&#12365;), which
means station, and another for the &#39365; kanji, with information about
meanings, readings, radicals, and a link to list all the words that use
it.</p>

<p>You can use the asterisk (*) character at the end of a word to indicate "<i>all the words that start with...</i>". Entering&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;" mce_style="font-weight: bold;">&#12379;&#12435;*</span> will display all the entries which Japanese reading starts with &#12379;&#12435;.</p>

<p>Finally, you can look for a strict sequence of words by enclosing
them within double quotes ("). This is useful for looking after precise
definitions. For instance, if you look for <span style="font-weight: bold;" mce_style="font-weight: bold;">to run</span>,
you will get all words which definition include the words "to" and
"run" in any particular order, which will produce a huge result set and
is probably not what you want. Entering&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;" mce_style="font-weight: bold;">to run</span>,
on the other hand, will only display entries which definition contains
these two words in that order, which is more appropriate if you are
looking for that verb definition.<br>
</p>
<p>By default, both matching vocabulary and kanji entries are displayed.
This behavior can be changed using the combo box right after the text
entry.<br>
</p>


<p>At the bottom of the search bar, you probably noticed these little buttons:<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>They are search bar extenders, and clicking them pops-up an
additional widget that let you perform searches using parameters other
than text search. In addition, the text button reflects their status
when they are closed.<br>
</p>
<h3>The Study Extender</h3>
This extender filters the results by their study state. One can choose
to only display results that are studied, or those that are not. In
addition, when studied results are displayed, one can also filter by
score, date of inclusion in the study list, or date of last mistake.<br>
<h3>The Tags Extender</h3>
This widget let the user filter the results by tag. Enter a list of
tags (or choose them using the combo box on the right) and only entries
having these tags will be displayed. The "*" wildcard can be used at
the end of a partial tag - you can also input "*" in order to show all
tagged entries.<br>
<h3>The Notes Extender</h3>
Shows only entries which note contains a given set of words. The "*"
wildcard can be used at the end of a partial word - you can also input
"*" in order to show all entries with note.
<h3>The JLPT Extender</h3>
Using this widget, it is possible to display only entries belonging to
a given JLPT level. Be aware that the JLPT lists are *not* official,
and that words and kanjis from the upper level are often randomly
included during the examination. Therefore,&nbsp; this list does in no
way claim to be totally accurate! <br>
<h3>The Vocabulary Extender</h3>
Widgets in this extender let you control filtering properties that only
apply to vocabulary entries. Kanji entries are therefore filtered out
when one of the widgets in this extender is active. You can enter a
list of kanjis that the word must contains, or choose to only display
words which are entirely made of kanjis you are studying. It is also
possible to filter words by their grammatical function, local dialect
they belong to, and other settings.<br>
<h3>The Kanjis Extender</h3>Using this extender, you can precisely search for kanjis. The following parameters are available:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Stroke count: show only kanjis that have a given stroke count.</li>
  <li>Components: enter some kanjis in this text field, and only kanjis containing them will be shown.</li>
  <li>Unicode: lookup by unicode.</li>
  <li>School grade: choose the school grade from which a kanji is learnt.<br>
  </li>
</ul>



<h2>The Results View</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;" mce_style="text-align: left;">The results
view is where your search results appear in concise form so that you
can review them quickly. Clicking on a result displays it into the <i>detailed view</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" mce_style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 614px; height: 133px;" alt="" src="sites/tagaini.net/files/images/resultsview.png" mce_src="/sites/tagaini.net/files/images/resultsview.png"></p>

<p>By default, results are displayed by pages of 50. This can be changed in the preferences. Use the <i>Next page</i>/<i>Previous page</i> buttons to navigate between pages, or click <i>Show all</i>
to display all results at once. This last operation can take some time
for queries with many results - however, you can navigate within the
set of already displayed results while the remaining ones are being
fetched. Also, don't forget that you can stop it by clicking on the
animated icon of the search bar or running a new query.</p>

<h2>The Detailed View</h2>

<p>The results view allows you to quickly overview the result of a
query and to apply a first eye-filter to it. However, when you find an
entry that looks like what you are looking for, click it to see its
full description in the detailed view. For vocabulary entries, you get
a detailed list of the readings and writings of the word, plus a list
of definitions with their corresponding part-of-speech, these gray
abbreviations on top of definitions. You can click on one of them to
get its full definition.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" mce_style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 606px; height: 355px;" alt="" src="sites/tagaini.net/files/images/detailedview.png" mce_src="/sites/tagaini.net/files/images/detailedview.png"></p>

<p>In addition, you will also get interesting information about related
entries, that may help you with memorization. For transitive or
intransitive verbs, Tagaini will automatically try to fetch and display
the counterpart of the verb (like &#19978;&#12364;&#12427;/&#19978;&#12370;&#12427;), and homophones. You can
use&nbsp;the icon at the right of the definition and the left/right arrow
buttons in the detailed view tool bar to navigate between entries. For
kanjis, you will get a list of kanjis that embed it, as well as some
words that use it.</p>

<p>In the detailed view, all kanjis are clickable. Clicking a kanji
will raise a popup window with general information, meanings, radicals,
and an animation of its stroke.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" mce_style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 283px; height: 263px;" alt="" src="sites/tagaini.net/files/images/kanjipopup.png" mce_src="/sites/tagaini.net/files/images/kanjipopup.png"></p>

<h2>Your Study List</h2>

<p>The study list is a simple, yet efficient way to discriminate
between entries you don't have any clue about and entries you think
should stay in your mind. When you see an entry for the first time, you
may have one of these three reactions: <i>I don't care about it</i>, <i>I want to study it</i>, or <i>I already know it</i>.</p>

<p>For the first case, there is nothing to do. However for the second
and third ones, you may want to select the entry in the result view and
right-click to display the entry's menu, and choose the corresponding
menu option to add the entry to your study list. You can also use the
buttons on top of the detailed view for entries displayed there.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" mce_style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 612px; height: 269px;" alt="" src="sites/tagaini.net/files/images/rightclick.png" mce_src="/sites/tagaini.net/files/images/rightclick.png"></p>

<p>You probably noticed that the background color of the entry in the
results view has changed as you added it to your study list. Every
entry in your list has a score ranging from 0 to 100 assigned to it,
and its background color depends on it. This score illustrates your
level of mastery of the entry. A score of 0 (the default when you
choose "<i>Add to study list</i>" means you barely discovered this
word/kanji but want to remember it. On the other hand, a score of 90 or
more (the default when you choose "<i>Already known</i>" indicates that
you perfectly remember it. The background of a studied entry is fully
red when its score is zero, but turns to yellow and finally green as
its score increases.</p>

<p>Once an entry is in your study list, Tagaini will ensure that you
get reminded about it, especially for entries with a low score.
Therefore, correctly marking all the entries you know and need to study
can make a difference when it comes to remember them. First, it affects
the sorting of results: studied entries always appear on the top of the
results list, with the lowest-score entries first. Also, it influences
the contextual information you get about an entry. Such contextual
information is not yet implemented, but future versions will display
things like a list of vocabulary you know that uses a newly-studied
kanji, or suggest kanjis that are only made of kanjis you already know.
Finally, it allows you to quantify your progresses. Do a <i>Search -&gt; Studied entries -&gt; All</i> and see all the vocabulary in your head along with their scores!</p>

<p>Score is therefore an important component to quantify your
progresses, but right now we just know how to initially set it to 0 or
90. How can we make it evolve after that?</p>

<h2>Training</h2>

<p>Training is an important part of the workflow of a Tagaini user. Inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>,
it features a flashcard-like practice that either displays the Japanese
version or the translation of a dictionary entry (or kanji and meaning
for kanji entries) and challenges you to remember the other part.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" mce_style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 496px; height: 433px;" alt="" src="sites/tagaini.net/files/images/training.png" mce_src="/sites/tagaini.net/files/images/training.png"></p>

<p>Click <i>Answer</i> to check whether your thought was correct or not, and then click the <i>Correct</i> or <i>Wrong</i>
button to update the entry accordingly. If you responded correctly, its
score will increase, otherwise it will decrease provided it is not
already 0. Note that the entry's menu is only usable and kanjis are
only clickable when the answer is displayed.</p>

<p>Training always works on the whole set of your studied entries, but
uses a probabilistic algorithm that makes lowest-score entries appear
much more frequently than highest-score ones. Therefore, you should be
displayed with entries you already know only very occasionally - and
this is a good way to check you did not forget them. To avoid
influencing the score with your short-term memory, entries are only
displayed once a day. Therefore, if an entry has already been trained
today, it will not appear again before tomorrow no matter whether you
replied correctly or not.</p>

<p>Had fun training? Have you noticed how correctly marking the entries
you know influences the way results are presented to you? Well, there
are other ways to help you organize and remember them.</p>

<h2>Tagging and Notes</h2>

<p>All the greatness of Web 2.0 for your Japanese study! Bullshit
apart, tags can be a great thing when used correctly, as they allow you
to group entries according to <b>your</b> logic, and not some
arbitrarily-decided similarity. Use and abuse them to tag your studied
entries by similarity of meaning, pronunciation, idea group, kanji
shape, whatever. Tagging an entry is possible through the results view
right-click menu and the training window.</p>

<p>Notes, on the other hand, let you complete an entry with your own
thoughs. Generally, they will be about particular usage notes and
special forms that are not displayed in the dictionary entry or are not
obvious. For kanjis, you can also list kanjis that look similar to you.
As for tagging, notes are available from the results view right click
menu and the training window. You can have several notes associated to
an entry: to add one, click <i>New note</i>, then select the note that has been created and type in your thoughts in the lower part of the window. Don't forget to click <i>Apply</i> before closing the window, otherwise your notes won't be saved.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" mce_style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 372px; height: 414px;" alt="" src="sites/tagaini.net/files/images/notes1.png" mce_src="/sites/tagaini.net/files/images/notes1.png"></p>

<p>Saved notes appear as a post-it like frame in the detailed view of
an entry. Entries do not need to be in your study list to be tagged or
annotated.</p>

<h2>Exporting your entries for external study<br></h2>

<h3>Printed Material</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, you cannot bring Tagaini everywhere with you.
However, the printing option gives you a possibility to continue
studying even when you do not have a computer around.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" mce_style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 700px; height: 481px;" alt="" src="sites/tagaini.net/files/images/booklet.png" mce_src="/sites/tagaini.net/files/images/booklet.png"></p>

<p>As of now, there is only one, quick, and dirty printing option: The booklet from the displayed results in the <i>File</i> menu. It will print a foldable booklet inspired by the <a href="http://www.pocketmod.com/" mce_href="http://www.pocketmod.com/">Pocketmod</a> on a single standard sheet on paper. To fold it, follow the instructions of the following video:</p>

<div align="center">
<object height="344" width="425">
<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/IAb31rIeGZo&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1">
<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/IAb31rIeGZo&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" mce_src="http://www.youtube.com/v/IAb31rIeGZo&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425">
</object>
</div>

<p>A typical usage is to select entries which you mitaken during training using one of the options in <i>Search -&gt; Mistaken</i>,
to print a booklet out of them, and study them while you are commuting.
Right now the printed material is still very concise and ugly, but it
will get better in future versions.</p>

<h3>Tab-separated file</h3>

<p>This option in <i>Results -&gt; Export</i> allows you to export
entries displayed in the results list into a format that you can easily
import into another software. It has been initially designed for <a href="http://www.ichi2.net/anki/" mce_href="http://www.ichi2.net/anki/">Anki</a>,
but will work with any software that supports importing items in that
format. To import your exported entries into Anki, select <i>Deck -&gt; Import</i>, then ensure the type of file is set to <i>TAB/semicolon separated file</i> and the model to <i>Japanese</i>. Choose your file, tick <i>Tag facts with duplicate fields instead of deleting</i>, and map the fields as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Field 1 to <i>Expression</i></li><li>Field 2 to <i>Reading</i></li><li>Field 3 to <i>Meaning</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, click import. You can now train the exported entries from Anki.</p>

<p>You should now know everything you need in order to start using
Tagaini Jisho efficiently. Please don't forget that this is still an
early version - check the website regularly to see when updates are
available. Also, feel free to submit your suggestions and report bugs
to the <a href="https://launchpad.net/tagaini-jisho" mce_href="https://launchpad.net/tagaini-jisho">Launchpad interface</a>. Have fun with Tagaini Jisho!</p>
